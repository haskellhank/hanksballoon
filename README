Hank's Balloon
==============

USAGE
-----
Compiling the project with `cabal new-build` will yield 3 executables: 'generate', 'analyze' and 'normalize'.

'generate' takes a number as command line parameter and produces a sample log of as many lines on stdout.
Example:

  ./dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.6.4/hanksballoon-1.0/x/generate/build/generate/generate 50000 > test.log

The log will have mostly valid log lines will occasional errors ('foo' strings) inbetween. The timestamps
are starting at approximately starting at 1st Jan 2020 00:00 and are approximately monotonically increasing
at a rate of 1 sample per second, i.e. there will be approx. ~60 samples with the same minute timestamp.
However to add an element of disorder, actual timestamps will vary from their nominal value by a normal
(gaussian) distribution with sigma = 500 seconds.

Temperatures in the sample log are of a gaussian distribution with a mean of 20 Celsius and a sigma of
5 Celsius. Locations are uniformly distributed across a 100km * 100km square.

'analyze' takes a log on stdin and prints statistics on stdout. Example:

  ./dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.6.4/hanksballoon-1.0/x/analyze/build/analyze/normalize < test.log

'normalize' takes a log on stdin and prints, on stdout, the normalized log with samples ordered by timestamp,
temperature in Celsius and locations in km. Example:

  ./dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.6.4/hanksballoon-1.0/x/normalize/build/normalize/normalize < test.log

ON TIME SORTING
---------------
Globally sorting all samples by timestamp is infeasible on large number of samples. The analyzer assumes that
timestamps are approximately increasing, with samples normally distributed around their nominal position.
The analyzer interates over the log, keep a buffer of approx. 5000 samples (minus ill-formatted samples).
At each iteration the buffer is sorted, the lower 2500 samples output, and the buffer replenished from input back
to 5000. Samples deviating more than 2500 lines (= 5 sigma, at a probability of ~ 3Ã—10^-7) from their nominal position
will be removed as invalid.
